# 11 — What the figures and the report actually show

A walkthrough of the report (`report/report.html`) top to bottom, saying what
each graph is and what the reader should take from it. Every figure is also on
disk at `figures/`; the links below point there.

## Before the figures: the two fixed blocks

- **Blocker banner** (top of the page): the open instructor question — may the
  dataset be swapped? Everything below is built so the question can be asked
  with evidence, not as a claim that the answer is yes.
- **Final block**: the manual checklist (what you must do by hand), plus the
  licence position. The licence is *not asserted* — cricsheet.org's licence
  page 404s, so attribution is by filename, URL and retrieval date only.

## Stage 1 — REAL-WORLD DATA

[`figures/01-data.png`](../../figures/01-data.png): a funnel chart of the
1,243 committed matches — how many carry a run margin (558), how many only a
wicket margin (660), and how many have no winner (25: 16 Super Over ties + 9
abandonments). **Point:** the exclusion counts are stated out loud, not
footnoted. No model uses the 25, and none is allowed to forget it.

## Stage 2 — MATRIX REPRESENTATION

[`figures/02-design-matrix.png`](../../figures/02-design-matrix.png): the
558 × 15 design matrix `A` as a heatmap of +1 (team won), −1 (team lost) and 0.
**Point:** one match is one linear equation in 15 unknowns; every row sums to
zeyro (exactly two non-zeros), which is the origin of stage 4's result.

## Stage 3 — MATRIX SIMPLIFICATION

[`figures/03-rref.png`](../../figures/03-rref.png): the RREF of `A` produced by
the hand-written Gauss–Jordan elimination. **Point:** only 14 of the 15 columns
are pivots — the reduction *is* the rank measurement, not an assertion.

## Stage 4 — STRUCTURE OF THE SPACE

[`figures/04-structure.png`](../../figures/04-structure.png): the singular
spectrum of `A` — 14 non-zero singular values and one exactly structural zero.
**Point:** rank 14, nullity 1. The missing direction is the constant vector:
`A @ 1 = 0`, so only margin *differences* are identifiable. This is the gauge
freedom that later explains stage 8's negative R².

## Stage 5 — REMOVE REDUNDANCY

[`figures/05-redundancy.png`](../../figures/05-redundancy.png): which of the 558
match rows became pivot rows (kept) and which did not (combinations of them).
**Point:** of 558 equations, only 14 are independent; the other 544 are
combinations. Linear dependence, made visible.

## Stage 6 — ORTHOGONALIZATION

[`figures/06-qr.png`](../../figures/06-qr.png): side view of the *two different
spaces*. Left: `‖qⱼᵀA‖` for all 15 columns of the thin QR of `A` — the first 14
are singular values of `A`, the 15th is ~0 because that direction sees nothing
of `A`. Right: the Gram–Schmidt basis of `Row(A)` in R¹⁵. **Point:** thin QR
orthogonalises the *columns* (Col(A) ⊂ R⁵⁵⁸), Gram–Schmidt on the pivot rows
orthogonalises the *rows* (Row(A) ⊂ R¹⁵). They are not the same space — this
project once conflated them.

## Stage 7 — PROJECTION

[`figures/07-projection.png`](../../figures/07-projection.png): `b·qⱼ` against
`(Ax̂)·qⱼ` for all 14 in-column-space directions, beside the residual itself.
**Point:** least squares is an orthogonal projection — `r` is perpendicular to
every direction in Col(A), and the residual is ~6.8× longer than the part of
`b` that was projected.

## Stage 8 — PREDICTION / LEAST SQUARES

[`figures/08-least-squares.png`](../../figures/08-least-squares.png): two
panels. Left: every match's fitted margin against its actual margin, with the
`y = x` line — the cloud is a cigar tilted the wrong way and centred away from
the origin, with **both** R² values annotated, each labelled with its
denominator. Right: the residual distribution, one standard deviation marked,
plus the winner-accuracy line. **Point:** the negative centred R² (−0.2103) is
the missing intercept (`A @ 1 = 0`), not noise — add the one column and R²
moves to +0.0181, still no signal. Winner accuracy 55.02% vs the majority-class
baseline 77.96%: negative skill.

## Stage 9 — PATTERN DISCOVERY (eigenvalues)

[`figures/09-eigen.png`](../../figures/09-eigen.png): the power-iteration
convergence trace `‖Mr‖` per step, beside the full spectrum of `M`. **Point:**
λ₁ dominates (λ₁/λ₂ ≈ 31.7), the trace converges, and the smallest Colley
share is > 0 — strictly positive, as Perron–Frobenius requires for a matrix
whose win/loss graph is one component. All 1,218 decided matches, not just 558.

## Stage 10 — SYSTEM SIMPLIFICATION

[`figures/10-diagonalisation.png`](../../figures/10-diagonalisation.png):
three panels — σᵢ per index, λᵢ = σᵢ² per index, and σᵢ² plotted against the
eigenvalues of `AᵀA` on the y = x line. **Point:** the
eigenvalues of `AᵀA` *are* the squared singular values of `A` — the 15×15
system is `A` rotated and squared, which is the symmetry-based view of the same
rank-14/nullity-1 fact.

## Stage 11 — FINAL APPLICATION OUTPUT

[`figures/11-ranking.png`](../../figures/11-ranking.png): the two rankings —
Massey ±2·se whiskers beside Colley rating shares, 15 franchises each.

[`figures/12-findings.png`](../../figures/12-findings.png): every coefficient's
t-statistic against the 2σ band (none reaches it), beside games played against
|x| (the extremity is not a games-played artefact — the refutation fits here).

[`figures/13-divergence.png`](../../figures/13-divergence.png): official table
vs Massey vs Colley as one slopegraph. **The payoff figure:** Colley tracks the
official table (Spearman +0.939), Massey does not (+0.093), and the two models
are mutually uncorrelated (Spearman exactly 0) on the same 15 teams.

## The text blocks between the figure panels

- **R² block:** prints *both* denominators, centred (−0.2103) and uncentred
  (+0.0214), each labelled, plus the +0.0181 intercept correction. Never one
  R² alone.
- **Findings:** the demo's stated result, including the refuted
  frequency-balancing hypothesis (`max|x|` made *worse*: 17.43 → 25.64).
- **Comparison table:** per-team official points, Massey rank, Colley rank.
- **Provenance:** the snapshot hash, the fetch date, the "archive hash not
  retained" note, and the not-asserted licence.
